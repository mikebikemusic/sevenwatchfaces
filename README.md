Pebble watch app demonstrating multiple watchfaces

Note: the button functionality in this source code is very basic. I refactored the code I wrote so that it can be easily understood and extended by other developers.

- The launcher code is complete and should not require any modifications.
- The config code provides basic app switching and may need only minor tweaks.
- The config7 code is where developers can customize the button functionality as desired. A simple example which provides date style switching for one of the apps is shown along with the hooks for each of the buttons to extend funcitonality.
